# Data-Science-Learning-Path
# 🚀 My Data Science Journey

Welcome to my learning repository! Here I document my progress, projects, and exercises as I transition into Data Science and AI Research.

## 🎯 Goal
My objective is to build a strong foundation in Python, Mathematics, and Machine Learning to solve real-world problems.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* **01_NumPy_Analysis:** Vectorization, broadcasting, and data manipulation exercises (No Loops allowed!).
* **02_Pandas_EDA:** (Coming soon) Data cleaning and exploratory analysis.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Git.
